## Running a project in development mode

5. Go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser. This
   page will automatically reload after saving changes to the project files.

## Files and folders

- All stylesheet parshas should be in the `src/sass` folder and imported into
  the page stylesheets. For example, for `index.html` the style file is named
  `index.scss`.
- Add images to the `src/images` folder. The assembler optimizes them, but only
  when deploying the production version of the project.
